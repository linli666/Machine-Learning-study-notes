# Machine Learning General Study Notes
###
1. Supervised
Learn to predict target values from labelled data
* Classification: Target values are discrete classes
* Regression: Target values are continuous values

2. Unsupervised
Find structure in unlabelled data
* Find groups of similar instances in the data (Clustering)
* Find unusual patterns (Outlier detection)
